This repository has FORTRAN programs written during my Master's coursework.
Each program focuses on a basic concept from Dynamic Meteorology, such as Vorticity and Divergence, Velocity Potential, etc.

The "About FORTRAN Codes.md" file explains each program. Meanwhile, the files with the extension ".f90" store the FORTRAN code.
