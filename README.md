# FORTRAN-codes
This repository has FORTRAN programs witten during my Masters coursework.
Each program is related to core concepts of Dynamical Meteorology.

Here's a brief description of each FORTRAN profram.

1. Vertical Velocity => Computation of vertical velocity using the equation of continuity

2. cres1.f90 => Objective analysis of geopotential height by Cressman method
   
3. geos.f90 => Computation of geostrophic wind and geostrophic vorticity using geopotential height

4. rk4.f90 => Solution of the ordinary differential equation using Fourth order Runge â€“ Kutta method

5. sf.f90 => Computation of stream function from geopotential field using Relaxation method Stream Function

6. velout.f90 => Computation of Velocity potential using observed or reanalysis wind data
